# Practice 6: physical engines. Simulation.
Simulation subject within the Multimedia Engineering degree from the ETSE - Universitat de València. March 2022. Practice 6. Rating 9. The goal is to understand the capabilities of physics engines to compose scenes with realistic physical behavior and to operate a simple 2D physics engine within the Rendering environment until you are able to create a scene.
